A responsive user-friendly expense tracker to help users efficiently manage their finances.

## Key Features
- A chart that provides a visual representation of stored expenses per month. 
- Allows user to filter expenses by year.

## Key React Concepts Learned
- This project uses reusable components to break up the UI into manageable pieces. 
- useState() to manage state changes inside individual components and derived state to update related UI components when a single state is updated.
- Event handling to manage onClick and onChange listeners
- Demonstrates form handling in React lifting state up and passing it down through child-parent component communication. 
- Controlled components which use two-way binding to synchronize data displayed in UI and stored in state.  
- Uses conditional content to update UI when a certain condition is met. For example the showForm() function in NewExpense.js
